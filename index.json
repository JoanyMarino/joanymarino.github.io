DEB theory offers a robust framework to infer and contrast energy allocation patterns, even in data-poor species. We used this approach to compare two thyasirid bivalves that have scarce data: *Thyasira* cf. *gouldi* and *Parathyasira* sp., which co-occur in a seasonal environment, show similar life history features, and are both particulate feeders. However, *T*. cf. *gouldi* hosts chemosymbiotic bacteria that are digested as an additional resource, and how this mixotrophy affects the energy budget of these chemosymbiotic thyasirids is unknown. We used allometric and life history data to parameterize a DEB model for each species and found that symbiotic *T*. cf. *gouldi* has a smaller fraction of its biomass as an energy reserve relative to *Parathyasira*. A smaller energy reserve, in turn, implies reduced energy assimilation and mobilization fluxes, lower somatic maintenance costs and growth rate, and larger energy allocation to maturity and reproduction in symbiotic *T*. cf. *gouldi*. For a thyasirid inhabiting an environment with seasonal forcing, these life history traits may represent an evolutionary strategy where the symbionts function as a partial energy reserve. Our results elucidate a potential role of the chemosymbiotic bacteria in the ecophysiology of a bivalve host, and highlight how the symbiotic association is likely to alter the energy budget of a mixotrophic thyasirid.","tags":["Mixotrophy","Ecophysiology","Seasonality","AmP","Chemosymbiosis"],"title":"Dynamic Energy Budget theory predicts smaller energy reserves in thyasirid bivalves that harbour symbionts","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joany Mariño","María Daniela Mendoza","Beatriz López-Sánchez"],"categories":null,"content":"   Non-metric multidimensional scaling ordination (NMDS) for the abundance of decapods associated with two mixed seagrass meadows at the Paraguan\u0026aacute; Peninsula, Falc\u0026oacute;n State, Venezuela ","date":1519858800,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1519858800,"objectID":"a0b952559c7b8aa2761fd88404a5d702","permalink":"https://joanymarino.github.io/publication/marino-2018/","publishdate":"2018-03-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/marino-2018/","section":"publication","summary":"*Thalassia testudinum* and *Halodule wrigthii* are the dominant seagrasses in the Caribbean, being common across shallow shorelines, either as monospecific or as intermixed meadows. Among the macrofauna associated with these beds, crustaceans are considered essential for the whole ecosystem functioning. However, knowledge about the associated community of decapod crustaceans in assemblages of *T. testudinum* and *H. wrigthii* is still scarce, particularly outside of protected areas. Here we report eight new decapod species for the Paraguaná Peninsula (Falcón State, Venezuela) in association with intermixed seagrass beds: *Achelous tumidulus* Stimpson, 1871, *Alpheus* aff. *floridanus* Kingsley, 1878, *Chorinus heros* (Herbst, 1790), *Clibanarius antillensis* (Stimpson, 1859), *Clibanarius sclopetarius* (Herbst, 1796), *Latreutes parvulus* (Stimpson, 1866), *Panopeus occidentalis* Saussure, 1857, and *Processa fimbriata* Manning \u0026 Chace, 1971. These records represent habitat extensions and fill gaps in the geographical distribution of the species along the northern coast of South America. Furthermore, we found that statistical differences in decapod species abundance and composition are likely to be caused by the joint action of coverage and heterogeneity of the beds. Our results indicate that typical Caribbean species were the most influential in the community; nevertheless, the abundance of juvenile *Penaeus schmitti* Burkenroad, 1936 was notable, since they have rarely been found in these habitats. This finding highlights the role of non-protected areas as nursery habitats for economically important species. Our results show that seagrass meadows in the Paraguaná Peninsula reflect overall good health when compared to other Caribbean zones, representing an important habitat for the maintenance of crustacean populations.","tags":null,"title":"Composition and abundance of decapod crustaceans in mixed seagrass meadows in the Paraguaná Peninsula, Venezuela","type":"publication"},{"authors":["Joany Mariño","Edixon Farfán","Manuel Caballer"],"categories":null,"content":"   Dondice parguerensis from Venezuela ","date":1293836400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1293836400,"objectID":"cbb305f110eaaf095ab6e91093b8ed4b","permalink":"https://joanymarino.github.io/publication/marino-2011/","publishdate":"2011-01-01T00:00:00+01:00","relpermalink":"/publication/marino-2011/","section":"publication","summary":"The presence of the aeolidacean *Dondice parguerensis* Brandon and Cutress, 1985, parasite of the cnidaria *Cassiopea xamachana* Bigelow, 1892 and *Cassiopea frondosa* (Pallas, 1774) is recorded for the first time in Venezuela.
